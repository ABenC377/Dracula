# Dracula
This is an app for playing the card game 'Dracula'.  Currently, this app only allows playing against a computer opponent.

'Dracula is a two-player game played over six rounds.  In each round, a player tries to maximise their score, and minimise their opponent's.  The scores of the six rounds are added together, and the final scores are compared to determine a winner.

In each round, players take it in turns to lay cards to fill a 3x3 grid.  The highest-value column is one player's score for the round, and the highest-value row is the other player's score for the round.
